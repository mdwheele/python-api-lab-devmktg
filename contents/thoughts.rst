Final Thoughts
++++++++++++++

With this app built from scratch, you should now have a solid idea of how a Python Flask web application can be built to integrate with the Nutanix Prism Central REST APIs.

For further information on the Nutanix Prism Central REST API versions and the data that is exposed by them, please see the `Nutanix Developer Portal <https://www.nutanix.dev>`_.  There will you find `code samples <https://www.nutanix.dev/code_samples>`_, `documentation <https://www.nutanix.dev/api-reference`>_ and information on everything from the APIs we used today (v1 on Prism Element and v3 on Prism Central) through to additional labs, technical articles and other sample apps.

Takeaways
.........

The Nutanix Prism Central v3 REST APIs have been designed in a way to make them easily accessible from any platform of your choice.  For example:

- Web application e.g. Python Flask as used today
- Script e.g. PHP, PowerShell, Python and BASH shell script
- Postman for GUI testing

For additional information on the Nutanix APIs, including the current API reference, please see the `Nutanix Developer Portal <https://www.nutanix.dev>`_.

We hope this lab was fun and informative - thanks for joining us!  Have a great day!
