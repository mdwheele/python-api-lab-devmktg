Final Thoughts
++++++++++++++

With this app built from scratch, you should now have a solid idea of how a Python Flask web application can be built to integrate with the Nutanix Prism REST APIs.

For further information on the Nutanix Prism REST API versions and the data that is exposed by them, please see the `Nutanix Developer Portal <https://www.nutanix.dev>`_.  There will you find `code samples <https://www.nutanix.dev/code_samples>`_, `documentation <https://www.nutanix.dev/api-reference`>_ and information on everything from the APIs we used today (v1 and v2.0) through to v3 APIs, the current "intentful" API implementation.

Takeaways
+++++++++

The Nutanix Prism REST APIs have been designed in a way to make them easily accessible from any platform of your choice.  For example:

- Web application e.g. Python Flask as used today
- Script e.g. PHP, PowerShell, Python shell script
- Postman for GUI testing
